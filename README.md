# PDF QA Bot using LangChain, Gradio & RAG

A simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** Question-Answering (QA) bot that leverages LangChain, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Gradio to answer questions based on the content of uploaded PDF documents.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a practical application of the RAG approach:
- **Retrieval:** The bot searches your PDF for relevant context using vector databases.
- **Augmented Generation:** It uses a language model to generate answers grounded in your document’s content.

Upload a PDF, ask a question, and get accurate, context-aware responses powered by LangChain and LLMs, all through a user-friendly Gradio interface.

## Features

- 📄 **PDF Upload:** Drag and drop your PDF file.
- 💬 **Ask Anything:** Type questions about the document.
- 🔎 **RAG Pipeline:** Retrieves relevant text chunks, then generates answers.
- 🤖 **Instant Answers:** Context-aware LLM responses.
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly UI:** Built with Gradio.
